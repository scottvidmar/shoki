# Shoki
Shoki was a king of ghosts that was believed to be a vanquisher and fighter of evil beings in Japanese and Chinese culture
(Zhong Kui in Chinese culture).

## Introduction
Shoki is a data analytics platform for tracking public events for pattern and scoring to determine probability of a serial offender, monitoring multiple data feeds and comparing to public sources of data. The goal is to use different types of profiling and categorization to build out a probability of serial crimes, which have the highest probability of being related, and potentially tracing the "trolling" path. 

This will also have functionality that allows for past cases to be analyzed once the perpetrator has been caught, has disappeared, etc... but some amount of profiling information and characteristics are known.
